This ansible playbooks are used to:

1. create multiple instances and deploy Mastodon crawler service on each of the
   instances.

   To start deployment, in terminal of current directory type in "./deploy_crawlers.sh"
   Follow the prompt to input (1) number of instance to deploy, (2) Mastodon server
   to crawl from, (3) database ip and (4) database name to store crawled data.

   The playbook will ask to verify instance creation, and require password. Typing
   password from MRC_password.txt

   The playbook will then do its work, the output from terminal is saved in 
   ./outputs/deploy.txt

   Created instances information is saved in ./deployed_ips/data_time.txt


2. delete multiple instances
   
   To delete multiple instance at once, we use the previous generated txt file.
   To start deployment, in terminal of current directory type in "./delete_instances.sh"
   Follow the prompt to input (1) txt file that saves existing instance info.

   The playbook will ask to verify instance creation, and require password. Typing
   password from MRC_password.txt

   The playbook will then do its work, the output from terminal is saved in 
   ./outputs/delete.txt
